        "body": "Present evidence indicates that the earliest plant domestication (the process of adapting wild plants for human use)took place gradually in the Fertile Crescent, the lands just east of the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeological data suggest the domestication and cultivation of rye as early as 13,000 years ago by people living at a site(Abu Hureyra) east of Aleppo, Syria, although wild plants and animals continued to be their major food sources. Over the next several millennia, they became full-fledged farmers, cultivating rye and wheat. By 10,300 years ago, others in the region were also growing crops.\nThe domestication process was a consequence of a chance convergence of independent natural events and other cultural developments. The Natufians illustrate this process. These people lived at a time of dramatically changing climates in Southwest Asia. With the end of the last glaciation, temperatures not only became significantly warmer but markedly seasonal as well. Between 12.000 and 6.000 years ago. the region experienced the most extreme seasonality in its history, with dry summers significantly longer and hotter than today. As a consequence of increased evaporation, many shallow lakes dried up. leaving just three in the Jordan River Valley. At the same time, the region's plant cover changed dramatically. Those plants best adapted to environmental instability and seasonal dryness were annuals, including wild cereal grains and legumes (such as peas, lentils, and chickpeas) Because they complete their life cycle in a single year, annuals can evolve very quickly under unstable conditions. Moreover, they store their reproductive abilities for the next wet season in abundant seeds, which can remain dormant for prolonged periods.\nThe Natufians, who lived where these conditions were especially severe, adapted by modifying their subsistence practices in two ways. First, they probably regularly burned the landscape to promote browsing by red deer and grazing by gazelles, the main focus of their hunting activities. Second, they placed greater emphasis on the collection of wild seeds from the annual plants that could be effectively stored to see people through the dry season. The importance of stored foods, coupled with the scarcity of reliable water sources, promoted more settled living patterns. The reliance upon seeds in Natufian subsistence was made possible by the fact that the Natufians already used sickles (originally used to cut reeds and sedges for baskets) for harvesting grain, as well as grinding stones for processing a variety of wild foods.\nThe use of hand tools to harvest grain turned out to have important consequences, again unexpected, for the Natufians. In the course of harvesting, many easily dispersed seeds would naturally be lost at the harvest site, whereas those from plants that did not readily scatter their seeds would mostly be carried back to where people processed and stored them. The periodic burning of vegetation carried out to promote the browsing by deer and gazelle herds may have also affected the development of new genetic variation. Heat is known to affect mutation rates in plants. Also, fire removes individuals from a population, which drastically and quickly changes the genetic structure of a population. With seeds for nondispersing variants being carried back to settlements, it was inevitable that some lost seeds would germinate and grow there on dump heaps and other disturbed sites (latrines, areas cleared of trees, or burned-over terrain).\nAs it turns out, many of the plants that became domesticated were “colonizers,” variants that do particularly well in disturbed habitats. Moreover, with people becoming increasingly sedentary, disturbed habitats became more extensive as resources closer to settlements were depleted over time. Thus, variants of plants particularly susceptible to human manipulation had more opportunities to flourish where people were living. Under such circumstances, eventually people would begin to actively promote their growth, even by deliberately sowing them. Ultimately, people realized that they could play a more active role in the process by deliberately trying to breed the strains they preferred. With this, domestication may be said to have shifted from a process that was unintentional to one that was intentional.\n",

            "translation": "现有证据表明，最早的植物驯化（即改造野生植物为人类所用的过程）是逐渐在地中海以东的“新月沃地”发生的。考古数据显示，早在13000年前，居住在叙利亚阿勒颇以东一处遗址（阿布胡赖拉）的人们就已经开始驯化和种植黑麦，尽管野生植物和动物仍是他们主要的食物来源。在接下来的几千年里，他们成为了成熟的农民，种植黑麦和小麦。到10300年前，该地区的其他人也开始种植作物。\n\n驯化过程是多种独立自然事件与其他文化发展偶然汇聚的结果。纳图夫人就例证了这一过程。这些人生活在西南亚气候剧变的时期。随着末次冰期的结束，气温不仅显著变暖，而且季节性也变得非常明显。在12000至6000年前，该地区经历了历史上最极端的季节性变化，夏季干燥期比今天更长、更热。由于蒸发加剧，许多浅水湖泊干涸，约旦河谷仅剩下三个湖泊。与此同时，该地区的植被覆盖也发生了巨大变化。那些最能适应环境不稳定和季节性干旱的植物是一年生植物，包括野生谷物和豆类（如豌豆、扁豆和鹰嘴豆）。因为它们在一年内完成生命周期，所以能在不稳定条件下快速进化。此外，它们将繁殖能力储存在丰富的种子中，以待下一个雨季，这些种子可以长时间休眠。\n\n生活在这些条件尤其严酷地区的纳图夫人，通过两种方式调整他们的生存实践来适应环境。首先，他们可能定期焚烧土地，以促进马鹿的觅食和瞪羚的放牧，这些是他们狩猎活动的主要目标。其次，他们更加重视收集来自一年生植物的野生种子，这些种子可以有效储存，帮助人们度过旱季。储存食物的重要性，加上可靠水源的稀缺，促进了更稳定的定居生活模式。纳图夫人能够依赖种子生存，是因为他们已经使用镰刀（最初用于收割芦苇和莎草制作篮子）来收割谷物，并使用磨石来处理各种野生食物。\n\n使用手工工具收割谷物对纳图夫人产生了重要且意想不到的后果。在收割过程中，许多容易散播的种子自然会在收割地点丢失，而那些不易散播种子的植物种子则大多被带回人们加工和储存的地方。定期焚烧植被以促进狩猎的行为，无意中为某些植物创造了有利的生长条件。",
